a) Parent Class = Spell
   Child Class = Accio, Confundo
b)
spell.execute() will print out 'Accio', however the other commands will cause an error
since they are class methods and not regular functions they need to be called with a variable
that has the class which has the class method defined to it. No variable is also assigned to the Confundo
class which makes it impossible to access the class methods inside the Confundo class.
c)
no get_description method is called, since it is a class method, calling the function immediately
without a variable that has the class with the class method defined to it will cause an error
since class methods can't be regulary accessed outside the class. However if the code would be fixed the
get_description method of the Confundo class would be called, this is because both the parent and the child
class have the same class method, the program will prioritise getting the class method from the child class first.
d)
add a class method into Accio class called get_description with a parameter of self (get_description(self))
in the class method, add the following code, 
return('This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance').
The indentation of the Confundo class should also be fixed
